# Performance Enhancement Technique for Traffic Sign Recognition using Combining Label Smoothing and Focal Loss

---

## Project Background
With the rapid development and commercialization of autonomous driving technology, the importance of accurate road environment perception is steadily increasing.

**Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)** is a key perception module in both autonomous driving systems and ADAS, providing real-time traffic sign information to drivers or generating vehicle control signals.

In real-world environments, recognition accuracy often decreases under adverse conditions such as **nighttime, rain, and fog**.

Recognizing the necessity of developing a robust object detection model that performs reliably under diverse environmental conditions, this study aims to **enhance the performance of a YOLOv8-based traffic sign recognition model**.

## Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)
<img width="450" height="43" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e4ba742-afe3-4166-8c03-29ab063b4d4b" />

- 𝑦∈{0,1}   : Ground truth (actual label)
- 𝑦 ̂∈{0,1} : Sigmoid output (predicted probability)

- Representative loss function used in binary classification
- Default loss function in YOLOv8
- Calculates the difference between predicted probability and true label
- **Tends to make the model overconfident in the correct class**
  &rarr; May cause performance degradation when dealing with class imbalance or hard-to-classify samples.

## Focal Loss
<img width="307" height="39" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34fa5e81-8037-4913-bcc8-52195fef4cf2" />

- 𝑝_𝑡 : Predicted probability for true class
- 𝛼 : Class weight
- 𝛾 : Focusing parameter → reduces loss for easy samples, focuses on hard samples

- Adjusts the weighting so that the model can focus more on hard samples rather than easy ones
- α assigns larger weight to minority classes 
  $rarr; **Helps alleviate class imbalance**
- γ gives higher loss to misclassified samples

## Label Smoothing Cross Entropy Loss
<img width="219" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b294a327-9c10-4528-8971-3b5b47f8701f" />

- 𝛼∈{0,1} : smoothing factor
- 𝐾 : Number of classes
- 𝑦 ̃_𝑘 : Smoothed label distribution

<img width="186" height="266" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15bf2b45-a321-4d71-94e1-1770f9207e92">

- 𝑦 ̃_𝑖  : Smoothed label distribution
- 𝑝_𝑖 : Softmax output (predicted probability)

- **Adds small uncertainty** to true class, preventing overconfidence in the correct label
  **&rarr; Improves generalization and prevent overfitting**
ex ) [0, 0, 1, 0] &rarr; [0.05, 0.05, 0.85, 0.05]

## Performance Metrics
- Precision : The proportion of detected objects that are actually correct
- Recall : The proportion of true objects that are correctly detected by the model
- mAP@50 : Average precision per class when predicted boxes overlap with ground-truth boxes by ≥ 50%
- mAP@50-95 : Average mAP over IoU thresholds from 50% to 95% in 5% increments

## Comparison of Loss Function

- BCE showed overall balanced performance, serving as a stable baseline model.
- Focal Loss achieved the highest Recall (0.870), indicating that the model **missed fewer objects** overall.
**&rarr; Suggests relative robustness to hard or rare samples**
- Label Smoothing showed the highest Precision (0.916) but the lowest Recall (0.785), indicating **a tendency for the model to avoid predictions in uncertain cases.**
**&rarr; more conservative, reduces overconfidence, improves generalization**

- No single loss function performs best across all metrics 
**&rarr; Combines the strengths of Label Smoothing and Focal Loss**

## Combined Loss : Label Smoothing + Focal Loss

- 𝑝_𝑖 : Softmax output (predicted probability)
- 𝑦 ̃_𝑖  : Smoothed label distribution
- 𝛾 : Focusing parameter → reduces loss for easy samples, focuses on hard sample

Combines Label Smoothing **(adds uncertainty to true class)**
Focal Loss **(assigns higher weights to hard samples)**
**&rarr; Prevents overfitting and focuses on hard samples**
